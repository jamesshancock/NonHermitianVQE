Controllable by the parameters at the top of main.cpp. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters and their meaning:

n = integer
- Number of qubits

System = "CTIM", "CQHO"
- Which test system we want to use. Note that we are no longer looking at this CQHO. 
- To change between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Ising model, you have to change "std::complex<double> ib(0, b)"  to "std::complex<double> ib(b, 0)" in grads.h -> Hamiltonian()

Observ = "Rmin", "Imax", "Xmag", "Sus"
- Which observable we are interested in measuring."Xmag" is x-direction magnetization and "Sus" is x-direction magnetic susceptibility.
- "Rmin" and "Imax" look for the groundstate and spectralstate, respectively.

exactOrQuantum = "Exact", "Quantum"
- Whether to use Lanczos or the variational quantum method.

noiseLevel = float
- Level of random noise added to inner product calculations.
- Sampled via a uniform distribution on (0,1), multiplied by this value.

variableMin = float
- Minimum value for Gamma.
variableMax = float
- Maximum value for Gamma.
variablePoints = integer
- How many increments of Gamma to test over.

Constant = float
- Bz, longitudinal field strength.

firstStepIters = integer
- Number of iterations to spend optimizing over parameters.
secondStepIters = integer
- Number of iterations to spend optimizing over parameters, E_R and E_I.

TOTALRUNS = integer
- How many full sweeps over Gamma to do.

maxLength = integer
- Number of samples considered for average-based stopping criteria.
avTol = float 
- Difference between average and current value for average-based stopping criteria.
costTol = float 
- Cost value that must be reached before starting the average-based stopping criteria

stepSize = float
- Step size sampled for finite difference gradient calculations.
gamma = float
- Weight for length of change of variable in decreasing gradient direction.
